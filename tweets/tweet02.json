	    "answer": "Green chips come from potatoes that have had too much exposure to light and have built up excess chlorophyll. In case you're wondering, the brown chips you see occasionally in the bags come from potatoes that have been kept in storage so long that the sugar in them has caramelized. It's fine to eat them, green or brown, in small amounts.",
