\begin_layout Section
Semantic Textual Similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of the STS problem is to assign a degree of semantic similarity
 to two sentences.
 This is a problem that has many applications in the Natural Language field,
 and has been presented for the first time as a pilot task in the Semeval
 2012 (Task 6).
 You can find a list of submitted systems, data and proceedings, in their
 official page:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Semantic similarity can be easily seen as a regression problem.
 With regression we try to learn a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\,:\, X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 where X is the sample space, in our case the infinite space of all the
 possible sentence pairs written in English.
 The values of this function are in the real domain.
 In this problem we actually talk about a restricted domain, lying in the
 range [0, 5].
 This, however, doesn't affect the nature and solution of the problem.

As mentioned above, solving the STS problem can be seen as solving a regression
 task.
 TakeLab - like many other systems presented for the contest - embraced
 the machine learning approach, and Figure 1 shows a quick scheme of its
 organization.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TakeLab actually presented two systems, called simple and syntax.
 Their difference lies in the set of features they use, although some basic
 features are shared.
 The syntax system tries to exploit more syntactic dependencies and similarities
 (for instance looking at the dependency parse trees).
 The simple system is more focused on numerical values coming directly from
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bag of words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 features, or from semantic-related tools such as WordNet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On average the simple system slighly outperformed syntax, so I decided to
 implement this one for the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Similarity scores
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A brief note: similarity scores range from 0 (totally different sentences)
 to 5 (the same sentence, even if in different words).
 This is maintained in my implementation too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Preprocessing steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before features are extracted, sentence pairs are briefly preprocessed with
 the following rules:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
tokenization and Part-Of-Speech tagging;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
hyphens and slashes are removed;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
angular brackets 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

<
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 appearing at the beginning or at the end of tokens are removed;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
some verb abbreviations typical of the English language, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

n't
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, are expanded to their non-abbreviated form;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
if a compound word appears as a single token in one sentence, but as two
 consecutive tokens in the other, then it is replaced by one token in both;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
stopwords are removed using a small list.
 Stopwords are words that are so common in the language that they bear no
 additional information about the semantics, and so can be ignored completely
 without loss of generality.
 Additionally, if two sentences have a lot of stopwords in common, this
 doesn't increase much their probability of being similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here I provide a quick overview of all the features implemented in the simple
 system and in my implementation.
 Detailed explanations and formulae can be found either in the Takelab paper,
 or by reading my code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An introductive node: the overlap between two generic sets is a measure
 of how much elements they have in common.
 It ranges from 0 (no common element) to 1 (identical sets).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
NGram overlap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we build two sets, one for each sentence, containing all the unigrams
 (i.e.
 tokens) from that sentence.
 The first feature is the overlap degree between these two sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then we repeat the procedure for (consecutive) bigrams and (consecutive)
 trigrams, that is sequences of 2 and 3 tokens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three additional features are obtained from the same overlaps, but instead
 of using tokens as they are found in the sentences we use their lemmatization.
 This is not present in the original Takelab implementation, but it was
 added later as an improvement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Wordnet-augmented word overlap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we try to take into account different words that have however a quite
 close meaning.
 Such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

closeness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is measured
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
using the path length similarity in WordNet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Weighted Word overlap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we assign more importance to words bearing more content inside a sentence.
 We define the information content of a token as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
ic(w)=\ln\frac{\sum_{w'}freq(w')}{freq(w)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So it's a measure of how frequently the token appears, compared with the
 total frequency of all the possible tokens.
 In order to obtain the frequency counts a corpus is needed.
 The Google NGram Corpus collects and counts tokens from millions of books
 written in English over a span of several decades.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Vector space sentence similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each sentence is represented by a vector obtained summing up the LSA vectors
 of its tokens.
 A first feature is the cosine similarity between the vectors of the two
 sentences.
 A second feature weights the LSA vectors with the information content of
 the token before computing the cosine similarity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A LSA vector measures how frequently a word is found in several contexts,
 with contexts represented by specific documents.
 It has been proved that sentence pairs whose words often appear in the
 same contexts are often assigned high similarity scores by annotators:
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

 contains a more detailed discussion about this, as well as many other technique
s for combining word vectors into sentence vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Normalized differences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two normalized differences between the sentences are added as features:
 sentence length and aggregate word information content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Number overlaps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This describes three features dealing entirely with numeric tokens, on the
 basis that the human annotators for the training set often gave low similarity
 scores to sentence pairs where the numbers differed a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Named Entity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two types of Named Entity have been considered: words starting with a capital
 letter, and stock index symbols.
 In the first case of course there is a loss of precision due to the fact
 that not all words starting with a capital letter are actually named entities,
 but perhaps the authors thought it was a good tradeoff with respect to
 using an external recognizer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the training sets provided for the contest, economics seems to be
 a recurring topic, and thus stock index symbols are mentioned in the sentences.
 Another overlap feature in the system is dedicated to them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
10-fold cross-validation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Support Vector Regressor needs some parameters that control its internal
 behaviour, depending on which kernel is used.
 Let's see how the best set of parameters is found among a span of possible
 choices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choosing the wrong parameters can affect the system performances a lot:
 we want our system to be able to generalize well to a test set that may
 be quite different from the training set.
 Indeed, cross-validation has been proved an efficient method in reducing
 the common issue of overfitting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the original TakeLab and my implementation use 10-fold cross-validation.
 I performed cross-validation on an union of all the training files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A k-fold cross validation starts by randomly partitioning the data into
 k subsets.
 k-1 subsets are used to train a model with the current combination of parameter
s, while the remaining one is kept aside for validating it.
 The training is repeated so that every subset plays the role of the validation
 set once; this way, the cross validation ensures that the performance doesn't
 depend too much on the initial random partition.
 Furthermore, the cross validation tries to create subsets composed of sentence
 pairs that vary as much as possible in their target scores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean of the results obtained on the k validation sets (usually measured
 in terms of correlation) is the performance measure for that particular
 combination of parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is repeated for all the possible choice of parameters we consider as
 options.
 The final choice used in the application is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}

\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Support Vector Regression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Support Vector Regression is a supervised learning technique which was developed
 as an extension of support vector machines for regression problems.
 Since it's supervised, we assume a given dataset 
\begin_inset Formula $D=\left\{ (x_{1},y_{1}),...,(x_{n},y_{n})\right\} $
\end_inset

 with n input samples drawn from an input space X, and target values belonging
 to the real domain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

-SV regression (the one used in my system) is finding a function f(x) that
 has at most 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 deviation from the real targets 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 for all the training data, while at the same time being as flat as possible.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is the maximum error the function is allowed to make while giving answers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's start with a linear function f, described as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(x)=w\cdot x+b
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
with 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in X$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Flatness means that we define the following minimization problem on w:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\min\frac{1}{2}\Vert w\Vert^{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
subject to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
|y_{i}-w\cdot x_{i}-b|\leq\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(the constraint on the allowed error).
 We are assuming that a function exists that solves this problem, but this
 is not always the case, and we may allow some variations for the norm.
 Introducing slack variables, the new problem formulation is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\min\frac{1}{2}\Vert w\Vert^{2}+C\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\xi_{i}+\xi_{i}^{*}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where C describes the tradeoff between the flatness of f and how much we
 tolerate errors above the threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using Lagrange multipliers it can be proved that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\alpha_{i}-\alpha_{i}^{*})x_{i}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\alpha_{i}-\alpha_{i}^{*})(x_{i}\cdot x)+b
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 values are positive Lagrange multipliers.
 Note how w is now completely described with a linear combination of the
 training samples, and it's not needed to compute it explicitly.
 Moreover, the complexity of the function is independent of the dimension
 of the input space X.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point we need to generalize the procedure to nonlinear functions.
 This can be achieved by simply preprocessing the training inputs 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 with a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 that brings them into another feature space F.
 Then the standard SV regression algorithm is applied.
 The SVR equations are rewritten as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\alpha_{i}-\alpha_{i}^{*})\Phi(x_{i})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\alpha_{i}-\alpha_{i}^{*})k(x_{i},x)+b
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where k is the kernel function; admissible kernel functions must correspond
 to the dot product in some feature space F.
 Note that now w must be computed separately.
 My system uses the radial basis (RBF) kernel:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K(x_{i},x_{j})=e^{(-\gamma\Vert x_{i}-x_{j}\Vert^{2})},\quad\gamma>0
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
SVR parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is now immediate to explain the meaning of the parameters we considered
 during cross-validation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
p is the threshold, or maximum allowed deviation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
C is the tradeoff factor in the minimization problem;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is a parameter of the RBF kernel;

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application expects most of the data (such as the similarity model,

 Moving or renaming files will most likely result in runtime errors and
 malfunctioning of the program.

\begin_layout Standard
the lib/ subdirectory in the project root contains the JAR files for these
 libraries.
 The stanford-corenlp-models.jar file is needed to load the machine learning

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sample files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Training and test files were provided by the Semeval 2012 Task 6, so that
 all systems could be evaluated on the same samples.
 Each sample file was actually split in two: one text file for the sentence
 pairs, called STS.input.<name>.txt, and another with the annotated similarity
 scores, named STS.gs.<name>.txt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to simplify command line arguments and I/O operations, the 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Google NGram Corpus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Google NGram corpus is a huge resource, collecting frequency counts
 for English tokens spanning across several decades.
 Unfortunately it is not really optimized for a huge sequences of queries,
 so I applied some processing steps in order to reduce its volume to a manageabl
e size, also in terms of occupied disk space:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the frequency counts for punctuaction characters were not downloaded, since
 their information content is not really relevant for this semantic task;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
all the counts for the same token, but different year, were summed together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
each row contains only the token, its POS tag, and the frequency count;
 additional information about where the occurrences were found were deleted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
counts have been 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

indexed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by the first two initials.
 The googlebooks/ directory contains a subdirectory for each initial letter;
 these subdirectories contain in turn a text file for each pair of initial
 letters.
 So for instance the a/ folder contains 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

aa
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for all the tokens starting with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

aa
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ab
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and so on.
 A special file oneLetter groups together 1-character tokens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All the tokens not appearing in an online English dictionary, stored in
 the dictionary/ folder, have been ignored.
 The comparison was case insensitive.
 The dictionary is the Ispell English Word Lists, chosen because it includes
 inflected forms of verbs and nouns (e.g.
 plurals).
 It can be downloaded from

Compiling and using the application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open a shell in the project root directory.
 The first step is setting the classpath so that both our source codes and
 the JAR files are visible to the Java Virtual Machine.
 On a GNU/Linux system you can for example set the environment variable
 with:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
\size small
$ export CLASSPATH=lib/stanford-corenlp.jar:lib/stanford-corenlp-models.jar:lib/li
bsvm.jar:lib/ws4j.jar:src/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, the paths you need to add are those to the four JAR files in lib/,
 plus src/ for our sources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now compile the application with
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
\size small
$ javac src/SemanticSimilarity.java
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And run it with
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
\size small
$ java SemanticSimilarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Running it without command-line arguments results in a small error printed
 on standard output.
 The application accepts arguments for training a new system, or for testing
 an existing one.
 The command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
\size small
$ java SemanticSimilarity --training <list of training files>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
performs feature extraction and training on the given sample file(s).
 The output is a SVR model, stored in 
\family typewriter
\size small
similarityModel.txt
\family default
\size default
.
 An example is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter

\begin_layout Standard
Testing a model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter

$ java SemanticSimilarity <list of test files>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

As mentioned, the parameters for the SVR have been computed in advance using
 cross validation, and they are accessible inside the application as simple
 constants.
 However, the project also includes a small Java class that performs cross
 validation.
 It has the same requirements as SemanticSimilarity, so after setting up
 the classpath as above you can compile and run it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
\size small
$ javac src/CrossValidation.java
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
\size small
$ java CrossValidation <list of sample files>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the end it will output the best choice, complete with the Pearson correlation
 it obtained on the samples.
 It is recommended that you cross validate on all the training files found
 in the train/ subdirectory for the most accurate results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Keep in mind that the task is quite computationally expensive, due, among
 other things, to the huge number of parameter combinations we evaluate
 (700).

The Pearson correlation is used to measure the accuracy of the semantic
 similarity system with respect to the Gold Standard annotations.
 I compute the correlation for each test file, plus two of the three aggregate
 measures described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "key-2"

\end_inset

: the ALL correlation is simply the correlation of all the test samples
 concatenated together.
 The Mean correlation is an average weighted with the number of samples
 in each test file.

In Table 1, my results are compared with the original Takelab results, found
 in their presentation paper, and with the baseline for the Semeval task.
 The baseline scores are produced using just one feature, a simple word
 overlap.

It appears that the low results obtained for the SMTeuroparl set are somewhat
 expected keeping in mind that systems for such complex tasks tend to overfit
 on the format of the training data.
 The Takelab authors state that the SMTeuroparl training set differs a lot
 from the corresponding test set: the latter tends towards significantly
 shortest sentences, and many short identical sentences are repeated multiple
 times.

Table 4 shows the biggest variation: C was set to the maximum value possible.
 Together with the terrible performances, it also resulted in a much slower
 training process.
 This is understandable looking at the value of P: the algorithm has to
 make an effort in order to keep the error below a quite restrictive threshold
 for almost all the training samples.
 It is my guess that such a complicated task is eventually managed by overfittin
g to the slightest details to the training set, hence the poor results on
 the test set.

The idea presented in Table 4 is partially verified by the results of Table
 5.
 Now P was set to the highest possible value too, allowing some more freedom
 in the training process.
 Indeed the training took place at the usual speed again, but still there
 is too much overfitting for good performances.

It must be noted, however, that results obtained from removing the preprocessing
 steps and the features may not correspond entirely to reality.
 For a completely accurate comparison I should have run the cross validation
 on the new set of features, and trained the model with the new parameters.
 This was avoided simply because the cross validation step is too much computati
onally expensive.
